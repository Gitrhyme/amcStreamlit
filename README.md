# AMC Macro
This Streamlit app can be used to track a clients suggested macro intake.

The app uses google sheets API to create a database that stores client and food information.

You can select a client from the database and adjust their chart breakdown based on the listed attributes.

Depending on client dietary restrictions, a list of food options can be populated to help them make the right eating choices.
